## Why Bother?

As a competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee player, I always have a Wii and CRT TV on hand to boot up a game of Melee. I've traveled to many different venues, and try to bring a setup when possible to help out the scene. Unfortunately, a full Melee setup is a lot to carry: a CRT TV, a Wii, the Wii's power brick, and AV cables. I wanted something a bit more lightweight and easier to use.
