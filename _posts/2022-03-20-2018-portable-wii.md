## The Beginning

I somehow stumbled across [this video of a portable GameCube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY7dWwoeXrU). I was instantly obsessed and knew I had to make one too. At this point in time, I had recently graduated high school, and had zero experience working with hardware in any capacity. Without a clue on how to proceed, I desperately tried reaching out to the author of the video, Zack Hale. I was shocked when he actually responded and offered his guidance any time.

After going back and forth with Zack for some time, I was eventually lead to [Kasar's GameCube portable guide on ModRetro](https://web.archive.org/web/20161007004157/http://forums.modretro.com/index.php?threads/kasars-gcp-guide.1654/) which became my bible. With the sacred texts at hand, I determined what I would need to build the portable. I wanted to make a replica of Zack's portable GameCube.

- A GameCube (not a Wii yet, more on this later..)
- Some way to remove the enormous disc drive and replace it with an SD card or USB drive
- Batteries to power the console
- A controller to embed into the portable
- A memory card to store game data
- A display
- Speakers
- An enclosure to house everything in

I began sourcing all the parts. To replace the disc drive, I picked up a (no longer produced) WASP fusion modchip, which allows GameCubes to boot games from an SD card. I got some 18650 cells for powering the console. I chose the same ZN40 case from Polycase that Zack had used for his portable.

## The First Attempt
I had never attempted soldering before. My first task to get started would be relocating the memory card. I (forcefully) removed the memory card ports from the GameCube motherboard and soldered a memory card PCB directly to the port vias. I also soldered an SD card socket to the other memory card port (a GameCube memory card is basically just an SD card)
