Dvorak is an alternative keyboard layout to QWERTY which aims to be more ergonomic and efficient. It places the vowels and commonly used characters on the home row. QWERTY, in contrast, has a pretty inefficient home row, with characters such as semicolon, J, and K. Dvorak is also optimized to maximize swapping back and forth between hands when building words, by placing vowels ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Finding the Perfect Guitar on Sweetwater</title><link href="https://jefflongo.dev/posts/sweetwater-scrape/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Finding the Perfect Guitar on Sweetwater" /><published>2023-02-15T21:23:00-08:00</published> <updated>2023-02-15T21:23:00-08:00</updated> <id>https://jefflongo.dev/posts/sweetwater-scrape/</id> <content src="https://jefflongo.dev/posts/sweetwater-scrape/" /> <author> <name>Jeff Longo</name> </author> <category term="Projects" /> <category term="Software" /> <summary> Motivation Sweetwater is a great place to shop online for a guitar. One reason for this is that they display real images of guitars they have in stock, and let you choose the one you like best. I was in the market for a Les Paul, but the finish varies (sometimes dramatically) from guitar to guitar due to the burst being done by hand. After internally debating between two different Iced Tea bur... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>GameCube Adapter Reverse Engineering</title><link href="https://jefflongo.dev/posts/gc-adapter-reverse-engineering/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GameCube Adapter Reverse Engineering" /><published>2022-09-05T14:25:00-07:00</published> <updated>2022-09-05T16:28:03-07:00</updated> <id>https://jefflongo.dev/posts/gc-adapter-reverse-engineering/</id> <content src="https://jefflongo.dev/posts/gc-adapter-reverse-engineering/" /> <author> <name>Jeff Longo</name> </author> <category term="Projects" /> <category term="GameCube Controller" /> <summary> Discrepancies with Emulators Dolphin Emulator, a Wii/GameCube console emulator, added native support for the official Nintendo GameCube controller adapter back in 2014. This was a huge step forward, allowing GameCube controllers to be used on emulator without the need for a custom driver to make the controller emulate a Xinput or Dinput device. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, the input ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Adding a Removable Cable to the FightStick Alpha</title><link href="https://jefflongo.dev/posts/fightstick-alpha-mod/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Adding a Removable Cable to the FightStick Alpha" /><published>2022-09-04T09:57:00-07:00</published> <updated>2022-09-04T09:57:00-07:00</updated> <id>https://jefflongo.dev/posts/fightstick-alpha-mod/</id> <content src="https://jefflongo.dev/posts/fightstick-alpha-mod/" /> <author> <name>Jeff Longo</name> </author> <category term="Projects" /> <category term="Mods" /> <summary> Motivation Back when Street Fighter V came out, I decided I wanted to learn how to play. I quickly learned that most players of Street Fighter, or fighting games in general, play on an arcade-style controller (colloquially referred to as fight sticks). I ended up purchasing a entry-level FightStick Alpha from MadCatz. After swapping out the stick and buttons, it was a pretty good stick.

Be sure to check that out if you haven’t already. Decoding the Commands To validate all of the previous protocol research, I created a protocol decoder for the Saleae Logic 2 software. Feel free to download it and try it here. Not only did this allow me to annotate commands so I could identify commands at a high level... </summary> </entry> </feed>
