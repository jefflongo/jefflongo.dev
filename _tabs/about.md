Hello! I'm an embedded enthusiast that's always busy tinkering away at some kind of project. I created this blog to document the projects that I work on for my own personal recollection, as well as to document things that I had to figure out myself in hopes that it will help someone else out. I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering at U.C. Santa Barbara in 2020, and my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at U.C. Santa Barbara in 2021. I currently reside in southern California.

My primary areas of interest in regards to engineering are embedded devices - microcontrollers, FPGAs, and just generally working in constrained environments. I have experience in full stack: designing PCBs, soldering, debugging hardware, writing bare metal code, and working with an RTOS. I've also worked with writing phone apps as well as desktop applications. Feel free to check out some of my projects on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/jefflongo).

In my free time, I enjoy retro gaming. I play *Super Smash Bros. Melee* for the Nintendo GameCube competitively by the tag YL. I also enjoy playing *Guitar Hero* and speed-running *Super Mario 64* for the Nintendo 64. When I'm not looking at a screen, I love playing music. I play the drums, guitar, and bass (some better than others..).

Feel free to reach out by email (icon on the bottom of the page) if you have any questions or want to chat.
